   - Launches in a standalone window without browser UI

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Fully responsive interface that works on all device sizes
   - Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
   - Adaptive layout that adjusts to screen dimensions

4. **Performance Optimizations**

## Development Notes

### Service Worker
The service worker (`admin-sw.js`) handles:
- Caching of static assets
- Offline fallback page
- Network request strategies
- Push notification handling

### Web Manifest
The web manifest (`manifest.json`) defines:
- App name and description
- Icons for various sizes
- Theme colors
- Display mode (standalone)
- Shortcuts for quick access to specific sections

### Icons
Icons are provided in multiple sizes for different devices and contexts:
- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512

## Testing PWA Features

1. **Offline Testing**
   - Open the application
   - Turn off your internet connection (airplane mode or network settings)
   - Try navigating through the app
   - Observe the offline indicator and fallback page

2. **Installation Testing**
   - Follow the installation steps for your platform
   - Verify the app launches correctly from the icon
   - Check that it opens in standalone mode without browser UI

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Open the app on different devices or use browser dev tools to simulate various screen sizes
   - Verify all UI elements are accessible and usable at each size

## Troubleshooting

- **App not installing**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.)

- **Updates not appearing**: Clear the cache or uninstall and reinstall the app

## Future Enhancements

- Background sync for offline data changes
